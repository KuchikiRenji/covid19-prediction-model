## One-line tagline (for social / links)

- **Technical:** “COVID-19 prediction model: ML-based case forecasting with Python and C++.”
- **Audience:** “Open-source COVID-19 case prediction and pandemic forecasting with machine learning.”

Use whichever fits your audience; the README and description above are aligned with both.
